# Learning Algorithm
### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
Considering the goal of the project and the environment provided, the Agent will be trained using a DDPG algorithm which tackles exactly the needs of this problem of continuous control as stated in this paper

The implementation of the algorithm is based on the template provided by Udacity at https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/ddpg-pendulum. A key factor of the implementation is the usage of an Actor-Critic Agent which enhances the estimation of an optimal policy by maximizing separately cumulative state-action values applying a gradient ascent approach (with Gradient Clipping added to avoid the exponential growth of gradients)
In this project, the actor-critic agent has been implemented in the DDPG_Agent.py file, while the actor-critic models are in the model.py file.

As stated in the DDPG paper stated above, to balance continuous space exploitation, the Agent has been provided with a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process which is responsible for adding noise according to the provided parameters: 

```python
OU_SIGMA = 0.2          # Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise parameter
OU_THETA = 0.15         # Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise parameter
EPSILON = 1.0           # explore->exploit noise process added to act step
EPSILON_DECAY = 1e-6    # decay rate for noise process
```

###Learning Steps
The learning of the Agents have been split according to the parameters below

```python
LEARN_EVERY = 25        #learning timesteps
LEARN_NUM = 10          # learning passes
```

### Agent Learning Model
Parameters
```python
BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e6)  # replay buffer size
BATCH_SIZE = 128        # minibatch size
GAMMA = 0.99            # discount factor
TAU = 1e-3              # for soft update of target parameters
LR_ACTOR = 1e-3         # learning rate of the actor
LR_CRITIC = 1e-3        # learning rate of the critic
WEIGHT_DECAY = 0        # L2 weight decay
LEARN_EVERY = 20        # learning timestep interval
LEARN_NUM = 10          # number of learning passes
OU_SIGMA = 0.2          # Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise parameter
OU_THETA = 0.15         # Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise parameter
EPSILON = 1.0           # explore->exploit noise process added to act step
EPSILON_DECAY = 1e-6    # decay rate for noise process
```

The Agent will be trainend according to the Actor-Critic models defined as follow:

### Actor Learning Model
```python
class Actor(nn.Module):
    """Actor (Policy) Model."""

    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, seed, fc1_units=400, fc2_units=300):
        """Initialize parameters and build model.
        Params
        ======

            seed (int): Random seed
            fc1_units (int): Number of nodes in first hidden layer
            fc2_units (int): Number of nodes in second hidden layer
        """
        super(Actor, self).__init__()
        self.seed = torch.manual_seed(seed)

        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, fc1_units)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(fc1_units)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(fc1_units, fc2_units)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(fc2_units, action_size)
        self.reset_parameters()

    def reset_parameters(self):
        self.fc1.weight.data.uniform_(*hidden_init(self.fc1))
        self.fc2.weight.data.uniform_(*hidden_init(self.fc2))
        self.fc3.weight.data.uniform_(-3e-3, 3e-3)

    def forward(self, state):
        """Build an actor (policy) network that maps states -> actions."""
        x = F.relu(self.bn1(self.fc1(state)))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return F.tanh(self.fc3(x))
```

### Critic Learning Model
```python
class Critic(nn.Module):
    """Critic (Value) Model."""

    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, seed, fcs1_units=400, fc2_units=300):
        """Initialize parameters and build model.
        Params

        super(Critic, self).__init__()
        self.seed = torch.manual_seed(seed)

        self.fcs1 = nn.Linear(state_size, fcs1_units)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(fcs1_units)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(fcs1_units+action_size, fc2_units)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(fc2_units, 1)
        self.reset_parameters()

    def reset_parameters(self):
        self.fcs1.weight.data.uniform_(*hidden_init(self.fcs1))
        self.fc2.weight.data.uniform_(*hidden_init(self.fc2))
        self.fc3.weight.data.uniform_(-3e-3, 3e-3)

    def forward(self, state, action):
        """Build a critic (value) network that maps (state, action) pairs -> Q-values."""
        xs = F.relu(self.bn1(self.fcs1(state)))
        x = torch.cat((xs, action), dim=1)
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)
```

### Experience Replay
Experience replay allows the Agents to learn from past experiences, a buffer has been added as follows 

```python
class ReplayBuffer:
    """Fixed-size buffer to store experience tuples."""

    def __init__(self, action_size, buffer_size, batch_size, seed):
        """Initialize a ReplayBuffer object.
        Params
        ======
            buffer_size (int): maximum size of buffer
            batch_size (int): size of each training batch
        """
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.memory = deque(maxlen=buffer_size)  # internal memory (deque)
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.experience = namedtuple("Experience", field_names=["state", "action", "reward", "next_state", "done"])
        self.seed = random.seed(seed)

    def add(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        """Add a new experience to memory."""
        e = self.experience(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        self.memory.append(e)

    def sample(self):
        """Randomly sample a batch of experiences from memory."""
        experiences = random.sample(self.memory, k=self.batch_size)

        states = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e.state for e in experiences if e is not None])).float().to(device)
        actions = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e.action for e in experiences if e is not None])).float().to(device)
        rewards = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e.reward for e in experiences if e is not None])).float().to(device)
        next_states = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e.next_state for e in experiences if e is not None])).float().to(device)
        dones = torch.from_numpy(np.vstack([e.done for e in experiences if e is not None]).astype(np.uint8)).float().to(device)

        return (states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones)

    def __len__(self):
        """Return the current size of internal memory."""
        return len(self.memory)
