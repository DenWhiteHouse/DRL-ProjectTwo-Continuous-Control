# DRL-ProjectTwo-Continuous-Control
Udacity Nanodegree on DRL - Project 2

# Goal of the Project

In this project is asked to train a double-joined arm agent able to tackle a target in the Unity's Reacher environment. As instructued the a reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.
The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.
